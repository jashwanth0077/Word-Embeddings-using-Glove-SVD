# Word-Embeddings-using-Glove-SVD
Investigating how word representations are shaped by different algorithms (SVD vs. GloVe), their context window, and their source, while providing a direct comparison between feature engineering and feature learning. Finally, we will evaluate these vectors against traditional lexical features in a CRF-based Named Entity Tagger.
